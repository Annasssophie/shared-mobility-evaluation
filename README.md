# shared-mobility-evaluation

This repository contains the code to analyse booking data from shared mobility services (e.g. bikesharing and carsharing) and public transport services. 

Here's the abstract to the corrensponding paper:
This paper investigates relationships between carsharing, bikesharing and public transport. The analysis relies on three sources of data: dockless bikesharing booking data, free-floating carsharing booking data, and General Transit Feed Specification (GTFS) data. We propose that by comparing the trips conducted with shared mobility services such as carsharing and bikesharing to public transport service data represented by GTFS data, a first indication is given on whether these services supplement public transport or if the services have an adverse effect.
Our results indicate that bikesharing is used almost entirely as a supplement to public transport. There is only a very small proportion of trips that could be conducted on a direct public transport connection. Contrary to this, we find that still a considerable part of the analysed carsharing trips is conducted although a (direct) public transport connection was available.
